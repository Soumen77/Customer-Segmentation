📊 Customer Segmentation Analysis using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation analysis to identify distinct customer groups based on behavioral and demographic attributes. The objective is to help businesses better understand their customers, improve targeting strategies, and drive data-driven decision-making.
This project was completed as a client project provided by Datamites, simulating a real-world business problem.

🎯 Business Problem

Businesses often struggle to understand the diverse behaviors of customers within a large customer base. Treating all customers the same leads to inefficient marketing, low retention, and reduced profitability.

The goal of this project is to:

Segment customers into meaningful groups

Identify patterns in customer behavior

Enable targeted marketing and personalized strategies

🗂️ Dataset Description

The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as:

Demographic details

Purchase behavior

Spending patterns

Engagement metrics

The data was preprocessed and prepared for clustering-based analysis.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

PowerPoint (for stakeholder presentation)

🔍 Techniques & Concepts Used

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature scaling and transformation

Unsupervised Machine Learning

K-Means Clustering

Elbow Method for optimal cluster selection

Cluster interpretation and profiling

📊 Analysis Performed

Analyzed customer purchasing and behavioral patterns

Identified the optimal number of customer segments

Grouped customers based on similarities

Visualized clusters for better interpretability

Created customer profiles for each segment

📈 Key Insights

Customers can be grouped into distinct segments with unique behaviors

High-value customers show different spending patterns compared to low-value segments

Certain segments are more price-sensitive, while others prioritize premium offerings

Segmentation enables personalized engagement strategies

🧠 Business Use Cases

Targeted marketing campaigns

Personalized product recommendations

Improved customer retention strategies

Revenue optimization and customer lifetime value analysis
